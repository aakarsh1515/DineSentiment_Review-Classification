# Restaurant Review Classification - ML Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify restaurant reviews as either positive or negative. By utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the model provides restaurant owners and managers with valuable insights into customer satisfaction, helping them improve their services.

## Objective

The main goals of this project are to:
- Collect and preprocess restaurant review data.
- Develop and evaluate a machine learning model to classify sentiment.
- Extract actionable insights from the classified reviews to assist restaurant management.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of restaurant reviews from platforms such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews. Each review is labeled with a positive or negative sentiment.

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Reviews are cleaned and processed by removing punctuation, stopwords, and tokenizing the text for further analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings are employed to transform the text into numerical features for model training.
3. **Model Development:** Machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, SVM, or neural networks are trained on the preprocessed data to classify the sentiment of the reviews.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the classification model is assessed through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Insights & Interpretation:** The classified reviews are analyzed to identify recurring themes, sentiments, and opportunities for improvement in restaurant services.

## Dependencies

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
